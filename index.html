            <h2><b>ABOUT</b></h2>
            <p><b>Hello!</b></p>
            <p>I graduateed  Mechanical Engineering in Taipei Tech, Taiwan, class of 2018. During my college years, full scholarships and competition prizes entirely covered my college tuition. I was the president of Crazy Robot Club, where robot-enthusiasts gathered and learned from hands-on projects and joined competitions together. 
            <p>I always learn from crafting prototypes and clashes of opinions, enjoy brain-storming with teammates, spend time in the machine shop, and love to build prototypes to apply my ideas in the physical world.</p>
            <p>My mission is to make technology have more practical impacts on the human-centered and environmentally-centric aspects.</p>
